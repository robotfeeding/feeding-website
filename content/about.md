Eating is an activity of daily living (ADL) and losing the ability to self-feed can be devastating. Through this project, we are developing algorithms and technologies towards a robotic system that can autonomously feed people with upper-extremity mobility impairments.  

Eating free-form food is one of the most intricate manipulation tasks we perform in our daily lives, demanding robust nonprehensile manipulation of a deformable hard-to-model target. Automating food manipulation is daunting as the universe of foods, cutlery, and human strategies is massive. To understand how humans manipulate food items during feeding and to explore ways to adapt their strategies to robots, we collected human trajectories by asking them to pick up food and feed it to a mannequin. From the analysis of the collected haptic and motion signals, we demonstrate that humans adapt their control policies to accommodate to the compliance and shape of the food item being acquired. We develop a taxonomy of manipulation strategies for feeding to highlight such policies and propose a set of haptic classifiers to generate policies based on a class of food items. Our analysis of success and failure cases of human and robot policies further highlights the importance of adapting the policy to the food item.  

Successful robotic assistive feeding depends on reliable bite acquisition and easy bite transfer. The latter constitutes a unique type of robot-human handover where the human needs to use the mouth. This places a high burden on the robot to make the transfer easy. We believe that the ease of transfer not only depends on the transfer action but also is tightly coupled with the way a food item was acquired in the first place. To determine the factors influencing good bite transfer, we designed both skewering and transfer primitives and developed a robotic feeding system that uses these manipulation primitives to feed people autonomously. Our experiments and analysis show that an intelligent food item dependent skewering strategy improves the bite acquisition success rate and that the choice of skewering location and fork orientation improves the ease of bite transfer significantly.

The <font color="#FF1690">Multi-agent System for non-Holonomic Racing (MuSHR) </font> is an open-source, full-stack robotics platform designed to advance robotics research and education by making a fully integrated robotic race car available in an easy-to-assemble and economic package.

Using rapid-prototyping techniques and off-the-shelf parts, we provide the instructions you need to assemble a robotic race car and code to hit the ground running. MuSHR also contains an ever-expanding set of tutorials to make you acquainted with the race car and robotic principles. 

The MuSHR platform was designed in the Personal Robotics Lab at the University of Washington's Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering. Taking inspiration from the MIT RACECAR platform, we set out to create an affordable full-stack robotics system which not only can support our own research and teaching demands, but those of the community at-large. The acronym MuSHR is inspired by dog-sled racing, “mushing”, where dogs (most commonly Alaskan Huskies) work together pull a sled. As the UW mascot is the Husky, we found this name especially fitting.

We have refined the MuSHR platform through two undergraduate and two graduate robotics courses, distilling lessons learned into the V3 roboracer. Want to teach a mobile robotics course of your own? [Contact us](/contact/) for access to teaching materials, including assignments and solutions.

## Who is MuSHR for?

### researchers 
Rapidly prototype your hardware, algorithms, or agents in the context of mobile robotics. MuSHR provides a mobile robot that is economic to construct and maintain, and starter code which allows you to focus on your project. Whether you are developing a new hardware system, perception module, or full-stack system, the MuSHR base libraries pick up the slack. The economic and rapid assembly also lowers the barrier of entry to creating a fleet for multi-agent robotics research.

### educators 
MuSHR helps educators make learning on real hardware a reality in the classroom. MuSHR course materials provide a starting point for teaching mobile robotics in higher education by making available classroom tested assignments that leverage the unique challenges of mobile robotics. 

### students 
Learn the principles of robotics and robot programming on your own, hackable robot. You will find the MuSHR tutorials useful whether you are trying to skill up for the Autonomous Vehicle Revolution or want to write code which pushes the limits of speed and control for an autonomous race car. MuSHR also serves as a valuable resource to those wishing to enter academic robotics.

### hackers
MuSHR can be assembled at any makerspace and is only mile 0 for your ambitions. Finally time to build that coffee-delivery robot? No problem.
